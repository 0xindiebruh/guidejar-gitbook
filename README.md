# Overview

Guidejar lets you create step-by-step guides and interactive product demos effortlessly. Users can explore your product interactively at their own speed, leading to better engagement and comprehension.

# How It Works

Embedding a Guidejar demo in your documentation is simpleâ€”just paste a Guidejar demo link into the GitBook editor. The link automatically transforms into an embedded interactive demo.

# Configure

To install on a single space, navigate to integrations in the sub-navigation. If you prefer to install the Guidejar integration on multiple or all spaces, navigate to your organization settings and enable it from the integrations panel. This will give you access to the custom guidejar block.
